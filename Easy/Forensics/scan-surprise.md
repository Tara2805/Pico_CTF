# Description
I've gotten bored of handing out flags as text. Wouldn't it be cool if they were an image instead?
You can download the challenge files here:
challenge.zip

## Walkthrough
This one is really easy, all it takes is no extra over thinking and think simply!

So download the file, extract and cd into the directory

There should be a QR code called flag.png

We don't need to perform anything else, except to scan the QR code. Thats it!

### Flag
