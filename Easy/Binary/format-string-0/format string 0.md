# Description
Can you use your knowledge of format strings to make the customers happy?

## Walkthrough
Download the source code and binary files. Then connect to the host using nc.

When we connect we get the option to feed the customers a selection of foods. 

Lets look at the source code to get a better understanding:

*Buffer Size:*
The BUFSIZE is set to 32, which is the size of the buffer used for user input (choice1 and choice2).
The flag buffer is set to FLAGSIZE (64 bytes), and the flag is read from flag.txt.

*Signal Handler (sigsegv_handler):*
If a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV) occurs, the sigsegv_handler is triggered, printing the flag. This is important because it indicates the challenge might involve causing a segmentation fault to reveal the flag.

*Burger Menu Logic:*
The program has two customers: Patrick and Sponge Bob.
The user is asked to input a burger for each customer. The input is compared against a predefined menu using the on_menu() function.

*Critical Functionality:*
In serve_patrick(), if the number of characters printed with printf(choice1) is greater than 2 * BUFSIZE (64 characters), it calls serve_bob(). This seems to be the part where you can influence the flow of the program, likely through input manipulation.
In serve_bob(), thereâ€™s another menu check, and after the user inputs a choice, it prints the burger choice using printf(choice2).
